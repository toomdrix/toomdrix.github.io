## Method

### Step 1: Mix Dry Ingredients
- **Ingredients:** 375g flour, 3 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)
- **Action:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon (if using). Set aside.

### Step 2: Mix Wet Ingredients
- **Ingredients:** 71g melted butter, 80ml oil, 200g sugar, 2 eggs, 80g sour cream/yogurt, 240ml milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract
- **Action:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, oil, and sugar. Add the eggs and whisk until combined. Whisk in the sour cream/yogurt, milk, and vanilla extract until the mixture is pale yellow and smooth.

### Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients
- **Action:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Fold together gently with a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. The batter will be thick. Do not overmix.
- **Tip:** Overmixing can make muffins tough.

### Step 4: Add Blueberries
- **Ingredients:** 210g blueberries
- **Action:** Gently fold the blueberries into the batter, being careful not to crush them.

### Step 5: Fill Muffin Tin
- **Action:** Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each to the very top. Sprinkle with coarse sugar if desired for a crunchy, sparkling top.

### Step 6: Bake with Temperature Trick
- **Action:** Bake at 220°C (fan 200°C, 425°F) for 5 minutes. Without opening the oven, reduce the temperature to 180°C (fan 160°C, 350°F) and continue baking for 25–30 minutes (jumbo) or 15 minutes (standard) until the tops are golden and a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.
- **Tip:** The initial high temperature helps create tall, domed muffin tops.

### Step 7: Cool and Serve
- **Action:** Allow muffins to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Overmixing the batter (can make muffins dense)
- Not filling muffin cups to the top (prevents tall tops)
- Using cold ingredients (can cause uneven mixing)

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If using frozen blueberries, do not thaw to prevent streaky batter.
- If muffins brown too quickly, tent with foil for the last 10 minutes.
