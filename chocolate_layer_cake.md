## Method

### Step 1: Prepare the Cake Pans and Oven
- **Ingredients:** Butter (for greasing)
- **Action:** Arrange an oven rack in the upper third and another in the lower third. Preheat oven to 180°C (fan 160°C). Grease the bottom and sides of three 20cm (8-inch) cake pans with butter, line with parchment, and smooth out air bubbles.
- **Tip:** Proper lining prevents sticking and ensures even layers.

### Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients
- **Ingredients:** 260g cake flour, 450g granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons kosher salt (or 1 teaspoon Morton), 1½ teaspoons baking soda, 1½ teaspoons baking powder
- **Action:** In a stand mixer with paddle attachment, combine all dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until just combined.
- **Tip:** Mixing on low prevents flour from flying out and ensures even distribution.

### Step 3: Bloom Cocoa
- **Ingredients:** 80g cocoa powder, 177ml hot coffee, 240g crème fraîche, 15ml vanilla extract
- **Action:** In a medium bowl, whisk the cocoa powder and hot coffee. Add the crème fraîche and vanilla, then whisk until completely smooth. Set aside.
- **Tip:** Blooming cocoa in hot liquid intensifies the chocolate flavour.

### Step 4: Whisk Eggs
- **Ingredients:** 5 large eggs, 2 large egg yolks
- **Action:** In a separate medium bowl, whisk the eggs and yolks until smooth; set aside.

### Step 5: Mix the Batter
- **Ingredients:** 180g neutral oil, all of the cocoa mixture, all of the egg mixture
- **Action:** With the mixer on low, add the oil and half the cocoa mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix until flour is completely coated. Pause and scrape down the bowl, then add the eggs and remaining cocoa mixture. Mix until very silky and the consistency of thin pancake batter, about 1 minute.
- **Tip:** Scrape the bowl to ensure even mixing and avoid lumps.

### Step 6: Bake the Cakes
- **Ingredients:** Prepared batter
- **Action:** Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans (about 550g per pan for even layers). Bake, rotating the pans after 20 minutes, until the tops are domed, springy, and a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean, 25–30 minutes.
- **Tip:** Don’t overbake; check at 25 minutes.

### Step 7: Cool the Cakes
- **Action:** Remove pans from the oven and let cool completely on a wire rack.

### Step 8: Make the Buttercream – Pudding Base
- **Ingredients:** 226g semisweet chocolate, 240ml whole milk, 100g granulated sugar, 24g cocoa powder, 16g plain flour, 1½ teaspoons kosher salt (or ¾ teaspoon Morton), 4 large egg yolks
- **Action:** Place chocolate in the stand mixer bowl. In a saucepan, combine milk and 50g sugar. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve sugar, then remove from heat. In a medium bowl, add cocoa, flour, salt, and remaining 50g sugar; whisk. Add yolks and whisk to combine. Slowly whisk in about half the warm milk, then return mixture to saucepan. Cook over medium-low, whisking constantly, until thick and bubbling, 1–3 minutes. Immediately scrape pudding over chocolate in the mixer bowl.

### Step 9: Finish the Buttercream
- **Ingredients:** 284g unsalted butter, 10ml vanilla extract
- **Action:** Let pudding sit for a few minutes to melt chocolate, then mix with paddle on low until smooth and glossy. Increase speed to medium and beat until cool to the touch, 10–15 minutes. With mixer running, add butter a few pieces at a time, waiting for each addition to incorporate. Add vanilla and beat until evenly mixed and spreadable.
- **Tip:** If the buttercream looks split, keep mixing; it will come together as it cools.

### Step 10: Unmold and Level the Cakes
- **Action:** Use a butter knife or spatula to loosen cakes from pans. Invert onto a rack, remove parchment, and cool completely. Level the tops with a serrated knife if needed.

### Step 11: Assemble the Cake
- **Ingredients:** Buttercream, cake layers
- **Action:** Place one layer cut-side down on a serving plate. Spread about 1 cup buttercream over the top. Add the second layer, cut-side down, and repeat. Add the third layer, cut-side down, and spread a thin layer of buttercream over the top and sides (crumb coat). Chill until firm, 10–15 minutes. Spread remaining buttercream over the cake.

### Step 12: Serve and Store
- **Action:** The cake can be kept loosely covered at room temperature for 1 day, or refrigerated for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before serving for best texture.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not bringing ingredients to room temperature (can cause curdling or uneven texture)
- Overbaking the cakes (check early)
- Not cooling the pudding base enough before adding butter (can cause buttercream to split)

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If buttercream splits, keep mixing or chill briefly and mix again.
- If cake layers dome too much, trim with a serrated knife for even stacking.
