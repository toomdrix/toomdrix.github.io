## Method

### Step 1: Prepare the Cherries
- **Ingredients:** 200g glacé cherries
- **Action:** If cherries are in syrup, pat them dry with kitchen paper. Slice each cherry into four pieces.
- **Tip:** Drying and quartering helps prevent cherries from sinking during baking.

### Step 2: Cream Butter and Sugar
- **Ingredients:** 175g butter, 175g golden caster sugar
- **Action:** In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together using an electric mixer or wooden spoon until light, pale, and fluffy (about 3–5 minutes).
- **Tip:** Creaming well incorporates air for a lighter cake.

### Step 3: Add Eggs
- **Ingredients:** 3 large eggs (lightly whisked)
- **Action:** Gradually beat in the eggs, a little at a time, mixing well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it might curdle, add a spoonful of the flour.
- **Tip:** Adding eggs slowly helps maintain a smooth batter.

### Step 4: Sift and Fold in Dry Ingredients
- **Ingredients:** 175g plain flour, ½ tsp baking powder
- **Action:** Sift the flour and baking powder together. Gently fold into the creamed mixture using a metal spoon.
- **Tip:** Folding gently keeps the cake light and airy.

### Step 5: Add Almonds and Cherries
- **Ingredients:** 75g ground almonds, prepared cherries, a few drops almond extract, 10ml milk
- **Action:** Toss two-thirds of the cherries with the ground almonds. Fold these into the cake mixture along with the almond extract and milk.
- **Tip:** Coating cherries in almonds helps suspend them in the batter.

### Step 6: Fill the Tin and Add Remaining Cherries
- **Ingredients:** Remaining third of cherries
- **Action:** Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared tin and level the top. Scatter the remaining cherries over the surface and gently poke them just under the surface with a teaspoon.
- **Tip:** This helps distribute cherries evenly and prevents them from sinking.

### Step 7: Bake
- **Action:** Bake near the centre of the oven for 50 minutes. Cover with foil and bake for a further 10 minutes, or until the centre is springy to the touch and a skewer inserted comes out clean.
- **Tip:** Ovens vary; check at 50 minutes and avoid overbaking.

### Step 8: Cool and Store
- **Action:** Cool the cake in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight tin.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not drying cherries (can cause sinking)
- Adding eggs too quickly (can cause curdling)
- Overmixing after adding flour (can make cake dense)

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If cherries still sink, try dusting them with a little flour before folding in.
- If cake browns too quickly, tent with foil earlier.
